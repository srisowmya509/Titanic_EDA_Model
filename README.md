# Titanic_EDA_Model
This project explores the Titanic dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features influencing passenger survival. It includes data cleaning, visualization (histograms, boxplots, correlation matrix), and feature engineering. A Logistic Regression model is built to predict survival, achieving around 80% accuracy
